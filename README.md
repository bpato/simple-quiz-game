# Simple Quiz Game (React + Vite)

This is a simple quiz game as example of how to use react.

I made this game to help me to memorize kanjis. The list of kanjis is included as a json file that can be modified to include any type of questions.

You can see a demo here: https://bpato.github.io/simple-quiz-game/ 

## Todo List

- [ ] Add a selector to switch modes.
- [ ] Make the question order aleatoric.
